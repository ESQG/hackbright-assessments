1/15 assessment part 2: Object Orientation

My main struggle here was to make doctests for taking user input!  Stack Overflow suggests the reason my program keeps freezing is that it's waiting for all the input in the doctests, without prompts.  So, I left those doctests out.

I also don't like that the administer() method only takes raw input, but I read the instructions as suggesting that, because they specified that I need not modify the original class methods I wrote.

I spent 2 hours, 30 mins on Saturday, and 20 minutes on Sunday looking this over as well as fixing a mistake (forgetting to use "self" somewhere to refer to a variable.)
