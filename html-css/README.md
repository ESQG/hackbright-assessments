Time spent: 1 hour.

I did try to incorporate HTML elements that would be compatible with readers, although I had to go off of a web archived version of WebAIM because for some reason their server is not responding to my request.  I'm not certain I did that in the best possible way.  Please give me suggestions!

Also, I did deliberately lighten the text boxes a bit from the default value of "yellow" (which appears to be #FFFF00, I mixed in 3/8 blue as well to lighten it.)
