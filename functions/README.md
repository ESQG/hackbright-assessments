Functions assignment due January 8, 2017

At first I was worried I wouldn't be able to turn it in due to the power outage!

I completed parts 1 & 2 in 40 minutes yesterday, then spent another 45 minutes today looking things over and doing part 3. (Edit: oops, 5 more minutes because I forgot a docstring and a minor edge case.)
